Working with the istio operator installed on microk8s

instead of port forwarding, you can route all traffic to internal 10.152.183.0/24 directly to the VM

# show routes
route -n
# which device routes kvm default network (last column)
route -n | grep ^192.168.122
# add route to microk8s CIDR block through VM
sudo ip route add 10.152.183.0/24 via 192.168.122.210 dev virbr0
# validate routes
route -n
